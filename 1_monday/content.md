## Initial Discussion
* Teaching Telepathy
    * The ability to maintain perspective of learner while communicating as teacher
* To clarify Oiclid's question and Sherif's answer
    * The asset itself is not what you are purchasing, but rather the block, or more generally, the metadata associated with the block
    * Why would I want this metadata if the digital asset is still still accessible elsewhere?
        * 
* You are registering yourself on the blockchain as the account that's associated
    * If I own an NFT, can I build a service that decorates the Blockchain that my NFT is persisted on?
* Forces someone who owns an NFT to sign a transaction which verifies their ownership upon accessing the Block.
